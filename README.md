# Wayve Web App

Wayve hopes to build tools to help teens and young adults manage their mental well-being. This web app is mainly meant to test a mood tracking feature.

## Features

- A mood tracking feature where users can regularly log and track how they are feeling
- A library of strategies sourced from verywellmind.com that users can explore in order to manage stress and anxiety
- A feedback form where users can let us know what works and what we should possibly include in the future
